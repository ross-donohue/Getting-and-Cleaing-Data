The data is broken down buy the following measurements 

Magnitude

tBodyAccMag - Magnitude of body acceleration
tGravityAccMag - Magnitude of gravity recorded
tBodyAccJerkMag - Magnitude of body "jerk" measured
tBodyGyroMag - magnitude of tilt
tBodyGyroJerkMag - magnitude of tilt attributed to "jerk"
tBodyAcc-XYZ - Three measurements along dimensional axes determining acceleration along a direction
tGravityAcc-XYZ - Three measurments along dimensional axes determing acceleration attributed to gravity along a direction
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ - Three measurments along dimensional axes determing direction of acceleration attributed to "jerk"
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ - Three measurments along dimensional axes determining direction of "jerk" measured by the gyroscope
fBodyAcc-XYZ - Fournier frequency transformation of tBodyAcc
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ - Fournier frequency transformation of tBodyAccJerk
fBodyGyro-XYZ - Fournier frequency transformation of tBodyGyro
fBodyAccJerkMag - Fournier frequency transformation of tBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag - Fournier frequency transformation of tBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag - Fournier frequency transformation of tBodyGyroJerkMag
