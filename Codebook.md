The data is broken down buy the following measurements 

tBodyAccMag - Magnitude of body acceleration

tGravityAccMag - Magnitude of gravity recorded

tBodyAccJerkMag - Magnitude of body "jerk" measured

tBodyGyroMag - magnitude of tilt

tBodyGyroJerkMag - magnitude of tilt attributed to "jerk"

tBodyAcc-XYZ - Three measurements along dimensional axes determining acceleration along a direction

tGravityAcc-XYZ - Three measurments along dimensional axes determing acceleration attributed to gravity along a direction

tBodyAccJerk-XYZ - Three measurments along dimensional axes determing direction of acceleration attributed to "jerk"

tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ - Three measurments along dimensional axes determining direction of "jerk" measured by the gyroscope

fBodyAcc-XYZ - Fournier frequency transformation of tBodyAcc

fBodyAccJerk-XYZ - Fournier frequency transformation of tBodyAccJerk

fBodyGyro-XYZ - Fournier frequency transformation of tBodyGyro

fBodyAccJerkMag - Fournier frequency transformation of tBodyAccJerkMag

fBodyGyroMag - Fournier frequency transformation of tBodyGyroMag

fBodyGyroJerkMag - Fournier frequency transformation of tBodyGyroJerkMag

Subject - an integer ID number identifying which of the 30 subjects the measurements belong to

Activity - A factor determining whether the subject is engaging in a variety of walking, standing, or climbing
